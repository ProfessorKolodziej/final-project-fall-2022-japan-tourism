	<h1>History</h1>
	<p>Tokyo's history can be traced back centuries. Originally known as Edo, it was a small fishing village that grew into a prominent city during the early 17th century when Tokugawa Ieyasu established it as the center of his shogunate. Edo served as Japan's de facto capital for over 250 years. In 1868, the Meiji Restoration saw the city's name changed to Tokyo, meaning "Eastern Capital," when Emperor Meiji moved the imperial court from Kyoto. This marked a significant turning point as Tokyo rapidly modernized and transformed into a global city.</p>
	<h1>Culture</h1>
	<P>Tokyo is a dynamic blend of tradition and modernity. The city offers a wide range of cultural experiences, from traditional arts like tea ceremonies and kabuki theater to historic temples and shrines.
